Currently a computer science Master's student at Uppsala University, I have a strong interest in both machine learning and game development. With a solid foundation in these areas, I aim to participate in research-oriented activities towards developing AI (or non-AI) approaches to practical problems, such as those found in the development of games. In addition, I enjoy exploring art, philosophy, and overall programming, which helps broaden my perspective and enhance my creative thinking.
