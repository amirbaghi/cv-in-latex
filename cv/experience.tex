        In September 2021, I got accepted for an internship position at Medrick Games, which is an active game publishing and development studio in Tehran, Iran. Working remotely from Shiraz during most of the internship period, I worked as an Unity game developer in the hyper-casual game development department. In addition to game development, I participated in game design tasks such as idea development and refinement. During this time, my team and I made \emph{four complete casual/hyper-casual mobile games} among other activities.
