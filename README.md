# cv-in-latex
My CV in LaTeX, based on the [Russel Resume](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/russelresume/zqnypvvjsfvq) template.

I have added new sections to the template to fit my needs. 
Also, I have added a flag to switch between a short (i.e. max 2 pages) and a full version of my CV. The content change based on the flag.
